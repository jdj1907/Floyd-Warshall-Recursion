# Floyd-Warshall-Recursion
An assignment by The University of Liverpool to re-write the Floyd-Warshall algorithm


This repository contains the code for an assignment set by The University of Liverpool to rewrite the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to use recursion.

**Before you begin**
------------

The code used in this assignment requires Python version 3 to be installed to run the code

**Getting Started**
------------

The University provided the imperative code to the algorithm and was used as a framework for the recursive version, please see **SECTION** for the imperative version.
